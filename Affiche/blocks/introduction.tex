We propose a novel way to handle out of vocabulary (OOV) words in downstream natural language processing (NLP) tasks. We implement a network that predicts useful embeddings for OOV words based on their morphology and the context in which they appear.

\textbf{Motivations:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item OOV words handling in NLP task is an \colorbold{underestimated problem}.
  % \item Goldberg (2017) emphasizes this fact for NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging (POS) or named entity recognition (NER).
  \item Few learned, end-to-end, solutions proposed.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Related work:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Pinter et al. (2017): Predict OOV embedding using the characters.
  \item Bahdanau et al. (2017): Learn OOV representation from their definition in a dictionary.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Goals:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Evaluate the impact of OOV words in labeling tasks.
  \item Provide a more meaningful way to handle OOV words using \colorbold{context} and \colorbold{morphology}.
  \item Understand when it is important and what is relevant to model OOV embeddings.
  \item \colorbold{Interpret the predicted embeddings} according to the surrounding linguistic elements.
  \item Provide a ``drop-in'', ``end-to-end'' module.
\end{itemize}
